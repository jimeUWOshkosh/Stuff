I did a 'proof of concept' on Ovid's Declarative Perl.

1) Didn't use constructors like Ovid did
     CP > 'Area' is a constructor for a Veure::Economy::Asset::Area instance...
   Didn't know how to do it so I just made lib/AssetSteps.pl

2) I used a source filter, "Filter::Simple", lib/myfilter.pm 

To execute
	perl run.pl
